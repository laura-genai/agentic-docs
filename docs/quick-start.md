# Quick Start: Your First Agent in 5 Minutes

This guide will get you from zero to a running AI agent in just a few minutes. We'll create a simple "Echo Agent" that replies with whatever you send it. This is the "Hello, World!" of agent building.

## 1. Set Your API Key

Our agents need a model to "think." For this example, we'll use OpenAI. Set your API key as an environment variable in your terminal.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
```

2. Create the Agent File
Create a new file called echo_agent.py and add the following code. It's fully self-contained!

```python

```

3. Run the Agent
Now, run your agent from the terminal using the python command:
```bash
genai ....
```
You'll see a prompt. Type a message and press Enter.

```bash
Starting EchoAgent... (type 'exit' to quit)
> Hello, world!
Received message: 'Hello, world!'
EchoAgent: You said: Hello, world!
>
```


Congratulations!  You've just built and interacted with your first AI agent using genai-agentos.
