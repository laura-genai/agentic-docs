## What is Agentic Atlas?

Ever felt like building AI agents should be easier? We did too.

**Agentic Atlas** is the infrastructure layer you've been missing. It's a set of tools and protocols designed to make building, deploying, and managing AI agents incredibly simple. Think of it as the operating system for your future agent workforce.

We handle the boring stuff—like making sure agents can talk to each other reliably—so you can focus on what matters: **bringing your creative ideas to life.**

-   **Model-Agnostic:** Use GPT or your own local models. We don't play favorites.
-   **Built for Collaboration:** Our Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol makes creating multi-agent systems a breeze.

## What Can You Build?

The possibilities are endless, but here are a few ideas to start:

-   A **personal coding assistant** that can write, review, and test your code.
-   A team of **research agents** that collaborate to gather, synthesize, and report on any topic.
-   An **automation workflow** that connects your favorite apps (like Slack, Notion, and Jira) together.
-   A **customer support agent** that can intelligently answer questions and escalate issues.
